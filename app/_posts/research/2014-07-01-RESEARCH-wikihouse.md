Fab Lab Limerick at the School of Architecture is researching about the use of digital fabrication technologies and open design methodologies in architecture design and building industry.

“Digital fabrication for Urban Regeneration” consists in the definition of a set of survey and fabrication tools, construction techniques and project management methods based on on-site, low-cost and self-replicable digital fabrication technologies. 

The goal is to combine the precision and quality control obtained in off-site industrialised construction methods with the adaptability and personalisation of on-site building construction in order to improve construction quality, energy performance and cost effectiveness of small and mid-size building projects within the context of urban regeneration in historical city centres. During this research a number of experimental construction methods –specifically [wikihouse](http://wikihouse.cc) and [Facit Homes](http://facit-homes.com/) – were tested considering feasibility, structural integrity, simplicity of the assembly and building quality.
