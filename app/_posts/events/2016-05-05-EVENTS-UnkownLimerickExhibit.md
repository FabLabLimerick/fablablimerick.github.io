Limerick City is going through a period of great change and regeneration. It is a candidate City for European Capital of Culture 2020 and through the ambitious 2030 strategic plan is preparing for the future. Limerick City is looking to transform, to rebuild its economy, to alter perceptions, to promote itself as an ideal location for investment and as a vibrant, culturally engaged place to live. Limerick is connecting with its people and its rich culture to imagine its future. 


As Visual Communications students in Limerick we have developed our own paths through the City. There are places and faces that we recognise and streets that we travel. However, have we truly discovered the city, explored its construct and examined its architecture? Have we observed the emotion and diversity that is present in the faces of its inhabitants? For this exhibition we went outside the known, the spaces that we were familiar with. We explored the hidden city, the streets, the areas and places that we have walked by but have not seen! Through this we begin to understand the connection between people and place and the stories in-between.


The Unknown Limerick Places project took inspiration from the results of Fab Lab Limerickâ€™s 'Limerick City Model Project' and was underpinned by the architectural photography produced for the City model project.
