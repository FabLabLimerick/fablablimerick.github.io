Fab Lab Limerick would like to invite people from all disciplines to a course on how to use our CNC (computer numerical controlled) Router. The course is an introductory course so no previous experience is required. 

The basics of creating a 2D drawing and then producing a cut object will be demonstrated through the course. Our ShopBot CNC router can be used to cut shapes up to 2440mm x 1220mm x 200mm in many types of timbers, plastics and some soft metals. 

We encourage you to bring your own laptops on the night and any 2D drawing softwares that you might already be familiar with.
