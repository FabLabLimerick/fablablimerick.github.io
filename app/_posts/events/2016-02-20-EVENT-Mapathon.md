This is a single day workshop starting Saturday Feb. 20th. No previous experience is required apart from basic computer literacy and an interest in digital mapping. Participants are required to bring their own laptop for the workshop.

**Outline**

In the Morning we will begin with a quick intro to mapping softwares(available during the course & online), Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and the culture and some inspirational examples of open source mapping projects. Participants will be familiarised with the following topics: Points, Paths, Polygons, Relations; Vectors, Coordinate Systems, and overlays. Animated maps, and 2D static renderings.

We will look at free map styling programs like MapBox Studio, to make beautiful map drawings or interactive web maps that you can embed on a website. Building on the previous work, the group will be split into teams, to set out their own tasks, exercises that require mapping and teamwork. Teams or individuals will map their chosen areas and contribute this to the relevant online mapping platforms.

This is a free event, however please reserve your place [here](http://fablablimerick.ticketleap.com/mapathon/) so we can keep track of numbers involved.
