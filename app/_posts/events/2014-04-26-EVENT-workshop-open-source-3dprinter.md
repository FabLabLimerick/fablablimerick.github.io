Have you ever think about building your own domestic 3D printer but you dont know how to get started? In this weekend workshop you will build a RepRapPro Ormerod Open-source 3D printer and learn the basis of 3D printing. 

The **RepRapPro Ormerod** is one of the most versatile 3D printers available. Its primary design goal is to offer a printer which is easy to expand in functionality, fast to replicate, and fast to assemble and commission. This new model builds on the already established RepRapPro product portfolio which has undergone brisk development and heavy testing since inception in 2004.

Seven participants along with two teachers will assembly this 3D Printer in a full weekend workshop (Saturday  and Sunday from 10:30 until 18:30). The workshop will cover all the aspects for being able to build an Open-source 3D printer by yourself. Please note that no previous experience in electronics or 3D printing is required. We have plenty experience in building these machines as you can see [here](http://fablab.saul.ie/research/opensource-lasercutter/) and [here](http://fablab.saul.ie/research/opensource-3dprinter/) so don't be scared it is much easier than you think!

The participants of this workshop will receive a 20 hours voucher for using any of our 3D printers after the workshop. In this way, they will be able to print their own parts for replicating the 3D printer that they just assembled during the weekend!
