A series of three workshops that will guide you from writing your first computer program to programming your very own text-based adventure game! CoderDojo Limerick will be running three workshops from Tuesday the 9th of February for adults interested in learning Python programming.

Workshops will run in Fab Lab Limerick from 7:30pm to 9:30pm on Tuesday 9th, 16th and 23rd of February. The classes will be run on a _"Pay What You Can"_ donation basis with all proceeds going towards supporting CoderDojo helping kids learn to code. Booking is advisable to reserve your place - booking link will follow shortly.

No prior knowledge of computer programming necessary, but you will need your own laptop (don't forget the charger) with Python 3.5 installed and a text editor (We recommend notepad++).
