Fab Lab Limerick will be holding a full-day course to go through each of the innovative digital fabrication technologies available at the Fab Lab. Perfect if you've missed our Wednesday evening courses, and would like to get a concise but comprehensive insight into digital fabrication technologies.

The course includes 4 mini-modules, with experience and trials on each machine:
* CNC cutting with the Shopbot CNC Router,
* Introductory Laser Cutting with the Lasersaur Open Source Laser Cutter,
* Advanced Laser Cutting with the Trotec Speedy 400 Laser Cutter,
* 3D printing with the Ultimaker2

For more information on the specifications of each machine you can check out [our wiki](https://github.com/FabLabLimerick/fablablimerick.github.io/wiki). For booking please book your tickets here: [http://fablablimerick.ticketleap.com/digital-fabrication-crash-course/](http://fablablimerick.ticketleap.com/digital-fabrication-crash-course/). Please note this workshop will only run subject to demand, catering to groups of up to 14.
