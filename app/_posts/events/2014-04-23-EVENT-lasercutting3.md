Staff and students @ Fab Lab Limerick have worked together to build their very own Laser Cutter. 'Lasersaur' is an open-source laser cutter with the ability to cut plastics, wood and textiles at a high speed with a high degree of accuracy. It has a bed size of 1220mm x 610mm and a 100 Watt laser output so it has the ability to cut and engrave large sheets of material.

Fablab Limerick would like to invite people from all disciplines to take part in a course to learn how to lasercut. It is an introductory course so no previous experienced is required. Lasercutting is the easiest form of digital fabrication we have to offer so it is a great course to start off with.

The course will introduce you to the idea of self build machines, it will educate you in laser safety and, indeed, it will teach you how to laser cut. At the end of the two hour session you will have the ability to process a 2D drawing into a lasercut object.

*The course fee is €6 per person.*
