You are invited to attend the Opening of the Mies Van Der Rohe Award 2015 Exhibition with Fab Lab Limerick, 7 Rutland Street at 7pm Tuesday 15th December. Five Irish architects have been included in the shortlist of 40 projects on show including Grafton Architects’ School of Advanced Medicine at UL. Pulp Press, Kistefos, Norway by SAUL’s Peter Carroll was one of eight Irish projects nominated for this year’s award.

Initiated in 1987 after an agreement between the  European Commission  and  the Barcelona City Hall, the 60.000€ prize is the highest award in European architecture and is awarded biennially to works completed within the previous two years. The principal objectives are to recognise and commend excellence in the field of architecture and to draw attention to the important contribution  of European professionals in the development of new ideas and technologies and of the clients who support them.
