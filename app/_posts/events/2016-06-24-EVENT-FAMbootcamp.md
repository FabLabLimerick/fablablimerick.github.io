## PROJECTS CALL
### Introduction to the Workshop
We are looking for proposals that experiment from an artistic and critical design perspective with digital fabrication technologies such as 3d printing, laser cutting and CNC milling. Any artistic discipline is welcome.

### Open Call Rules and Regulations for Proposals
The call is open to any artist based in the Republic of Ireland with existing experience in digital fabrication technologies within his/her artistic practice.

Two proposals will be developed during the bootcamp, selected from the applications to this open call. Each artist responsible will lead a group of six collaborators during the bootcamp. The proposals submitted must be open to the participation of the collaborators during the bootcamp.

### Workshop Schedule
On **July 4th** an initial presentation of both projects will be held.

From **July 4th to July 15th** the projects will be developed in groups lead by the selected artists and the support of the collaborators; the results will be presented on the final day.

During the workshop, ideas will be tested out and prototypes will be developed in interdisciplinary groups composed of all interested participants, coordinated by the artist. The groups will be supported by Fab Lab Limerick technical staff and will have the space, equipment and materials necessary to develop each project.
These must be requested in the initial proposal.

### Obligations of Selected Parties
Selected individuals, collaborators and project leaders, will have to attend all days of the workshop. Selected individuals will have to finish and appropriately document the proposed projects. Basic information on the projects will be documented in Fab Lab Limerick wiki/web page.

The projects submitted must be open to and promote the participation of collaborators.

Project credits shall list the participation of each member of the team and their role within the bootcamp. Fab Lab Limerick  encourages and supports the use of open-source programs and licenses for the purpose of developing the projects.

On completion of the SUMMER BOOTCAMP, participants will have to remove their material within a maximum period of 15 days.

### Project Evaluation Criteria
- Relevance to the general aims and theme of the call.
- Innovative and experimental in nature.
- Reasonable use of materials and digital fabrication equipment.
- Clarity of the proposal and suitability of the methodology and bootcamp development time (the aim is to produce a prototype by the end of the bootcamp. The proposal must therefore detail all parts of the project for which a prototype could be produced within the allotted period, and the parts for which this would be impossible.)

### Accommodation and Travel Expenses
Upon request by participants who reside outside of Limerick, Fab Lab Limerick will provide accommodation in student accommodation for the duration of the bootcamp. Fab Lab Limerick will also cover travel expenses (within the Republic of Ireland) for one person per selected project.  

### Registration
Anyone interested in participating in the workshop must complete and send the form provided below before June 10th at 5:00pm GMT+1.

### Selection Committee
Fab Lab Limerick will be responsible for the evaluation and selection of the projects.

### Authorship and Intellectual Property
Participants in the open call whose projects (texts, photographs and videos) are selected shall license their work in a manner permitting Fab Lab Limerick to publish it in any physical or digital format for the maximum time period and territorial scope provided for by law, allowing said work to be transformed in order to improve its dissemination and distribution. After projects have been selected, while the activity is underway the author shall be obligated to permit any other participant(s) in the activity that has been convened to use their work as the basis for other derivative work.

### Further Instructions for the Proposals
 If the field destined to the “Summary of the Proposal” does not offer enough space, we kindly ask you to use the “Description” field. In order to make it easier for prospective collaborators for your project, we encourage you to make a simple and brief (2-3 minutes) video regarding your proposal. For any other questions about the proposal please contact fablab@saul.ie
