If you are interested in exhibiting in our Makers Gallery send us an email describing yourself and your artwork including photos of the pieces that you will display, how you have used digital fabrication technologies and your preferred days for the exhibition –It is recommended that you provide at least two tentative dates in order to accommodate all the requests–

Makers will be responsible for setting up, invigilating and taking down their own artwork. Each maker exhibition will have a maximum of seven days of duration and will be subject to Fab Lab Limerick cultural programme. Fab Lab Limerick will not be responsible for any damaged artwork.
