ATTIRE is a series of research workshops that aims to implement various electronic principles into a fashion garment. During these workshops we will be connecting various disciplines such as fashion design, software and hardware design, dressmaking and 3D printing.

The main focus will be on addressing issues such as suitable materials, battery solutions, durability, micro controllers, sensors, and much more. This is an exiting new territory and it is all happening here in Limerick City.

Introduction to the workshop will take place on the 7th of march at 10am. There will be presentations from experts in the according fields and we will talk about the goal of the workshop and what will be coming in the following weeks! This first introductory workshop is free so be sure to come along and learn more about the topic well be exploring.
