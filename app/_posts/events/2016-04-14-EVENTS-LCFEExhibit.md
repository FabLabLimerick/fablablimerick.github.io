This is an exhibition of works for the Limerick Lifelong Learning Festival, by students from the Limerick College of Further Education Fashion Department, mentored by Miia Satama and recent LCFE graduate, Asta Alminaite. This exhibition is sponsored by 'Creative Engagement' and produced in collaboration with Fab Lab Limerick.

In January, students were asked to design contemporary fashion accessories to be produced using the digital fabrication facilities at Fab Lab Limerick. The students' design, research and development, which was then drawn and modelled digitally, culminated in this collection of completely unique accessories.

Come and see us showcase this innovative project at Fab Lab Limerick, No. 7 Rutland Street, Limerick from 14th to 18th of April.
