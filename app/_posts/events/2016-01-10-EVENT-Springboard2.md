The Certificate in Digital Fabrication - Design & Manufacture is offered to give participants an insight into digital fabrication which is underpinning a manufacturing revolution.

Covering a broad range of technologies that offer the prospects of on-demand, mass personalisation, with more localized, flexible and sustainable production.
FabLab Limerick, where the course will be run, is a new multidisciplinary design and manufacturing hub promoted by the University of Limerick in Limerick City Centre.

The space is equipped with the latest digital fabrication technologies such as 3D printing, Laser Cutting and CNC milling which are accessible to designers, craftspersons, entrepreneurs and industry.

As the culture of digital fabrication is fast paced it is important to keep up to date with the new technologies and innovations. A range of teaching methods will support the progression of participants work - combining theory lectures, software and hardware tutorials, desk reviews and public presentations. This format will offer the skills required for effective project implementation and the ability to manage the organisation of tasks, people and resources.

- Design studio. A studio space will be available throughout the course allowing students an open environment to complete their project work.

- Theory lectures on digital fabrication. Knowledge of the state of the art in digital fabrication. The programme will show the potential that lies within FabLabs as spaces for innovation and creation.

- Expertise in software tools. Participants will gain knowledge in a broad range of Computer Aided Design in 2D and 3D as well as Computer Aided Manufacturing such as SolidWorks, Autocad, Rhino, SketchUp, Illustrator, Inkscape, VCarvePro and more.

- Expertise in machine operation. How to operate a broad range of digital fabrication equipment –3D printing, Laser Cutting and CNC milling- as well as troubleshooting and maintenance skills.

- The course will be marked by continuous assessment therefore students will be reviewed weekly by teaching staff and visiting lecturers]\'

The programme comprises Taught Modules and a Job Readiness Programme and an Industry Learning Experience.

An industry learning experience (company project) will form a key element of the programme, ensuring the integration of the various concepts in the participant’s portfolio.

Job readiness and support into employment will be provided through a series of workshops and seminars and an active engagement with motivated students in attaining employment.
