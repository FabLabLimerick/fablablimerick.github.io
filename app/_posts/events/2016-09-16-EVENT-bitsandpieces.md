**Start at:** Fab Lab Limerick, 6pm to 9pm.

Starting at Fab Lab Limerick, you are invited to collect specially designed pieces which each have been made specially in Fab Lab Limerick, to their ultimate destination in the Hunt Museum, to collaboratively construct a spontaneous, on-site sculpture in the Captainâ€™s Room.

The sculpture, along with the names of the participants, will form a completely unique assembly, built just for Culture Night 2016.

In collaboration with [The Hunt Museum](http://www.huntmuseum.com/).

For more details, check out the [Culture Night website](http://www.culturenight.ie/regional_event/bits-and-pieces/).
