This is a single day workshop to be held on Saturday the 16th of January 2016. No previous experience is required apart from basic computer literacy. A selection of materials will be provided as part of the course to make their case/slieve. Participants are welcome to bring other materials to the workshop if they wish to do so.

**Outline**

Participants will be guided through the process of designing and creating the their own patterns for soft-cover laptop cases. Introduction will consist of the presentation of various designs for cases, a session of brainstorming, explanation of basic design principles, introduction of Inkscape 2D drawing software and demonstration of our in-house Laser-cutter. After the introduction everyone will have a better understanding of how their case can be created.  Inkscape installation and basic usage will be clearly explained. Inkscape drawing software for Prototyping and Digital Fabrication has been designed for new and inexperienced users who wish to become familiar with the basics of vector creation using open source software. At the end of the day everyone will have his or her personal signage file ready to be cut in the afternoon. 

Everyone will be introduced to the Lasercutter to be able to cut out their own design. After all pieces are cut we will assemble and sew and apply finishing touches. At the end of the day all participants will have a laptop case or slieve of their own design that they can take home with them.

The cost of the Workshop is €50 per student and €70 per adult (including materials). The workshop will be from 10.30 to 16.00 Saturday the 16th. Participants are required to bring a laptop and a mouse with them.
