In celebration of European Maker Week we would like to invite you to sample a mixture of technical, electronic and digitally fabricated projects - made right here in Limerick. Featuring speakers making their own 3D printers, Raspberry Pi-based automation systems, digitally fabricated light-weight tri-copters and more!

Starting from 7:30pm at Fab Lab Limerick - No. 7 Rutland Street.

This is a free event and no booking is required!

This event is supported by Fab Foundation Ireland - an all-island network of digital fabrication laboratories. Fab Labs make available at street level within communities a range of digital fabrication technologies, including computer aided design and manufacturing and 3D printing. The principal objective of Fab Foundation Ireland is to encourage and support the establishment of Fab Labs on the island of Ireland
