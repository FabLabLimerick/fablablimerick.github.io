CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT event within a series of wearable electronics workshops.

During this workshop we will evaluate the research and narrow down the ideas towards a final concept, by establishing the purpose of the garment and its electronic features.

The function of the garment could fall under one of these categories:
… performance, sci-fi, sport & fitness, lifestyle computing, safety & security, communication, glamour, travel, entertainment …

This is the core event and start of the mission so if you are:
…fashion designer, software and hardware developer, dressmaker, product designer, 3D illustrator & 3D printer fan, thinker and innovator …

make sure you come along to explore the topic and have
your ideas included in the mix.
