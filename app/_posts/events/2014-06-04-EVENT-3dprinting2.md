Staff and students @ Fab Lab Limerick have worked together to build their very own 3D printers. The 'ReprapPro Mendel' is an open-source 3D printer with the ability to print 3D objects in variety of plastics, It has the ability to produce objects up to 210mm x 190 mm x 140mm in size.

Fab Lab Limerick would like to invite people from all disciplines to take part in a course to learn how to 3D print. It is an introductory course so no previous experienced is required. 

The course will introduce you to the idea of self build machines. The 3D printing process will be explained and demonstrated so that you will be able to bring a simple 3D idea from concept to print. 

We encourage you to bring your own laptops on the night so that softwares can be installed. Our [wiki](https://github.com/FabLabLimerick/fablablimerick.github.io/wiki) has information on these softwares if you would like to get a head-start.

*This workshop is co-hosted together with local 3D printer pioneer Ivor O'Shea, you can find more info about Ivor on [his blog](http://numbersixreprap.blogspot.com.es)* 

*The course fee is €6 per person and places are limited.[You can book your place here](http://fablablimerick.ticketleap.com/introduction-to-3d-printing2/)*

Looking forward to some 3D printing!
