title: Coding Workshops with CoderDojo Limerick
---

This is a series of three workshops that will guide you from writing your first computer program to programming a text-based adventure game. CoderDojo Limerick are looking for adults who are interested in learning Python programming.

We will be running a series of workshops over three Tuesday evenings in November in Limerick Fab Lab from 7pm to 9pm. 
The workshops will take place on Tuesday 10th, 17th and 24th of November and are aimed at absolute beginners.

If you would like to take part, please book a ticket [through this link](http://python1.eventbrite.ie).

The workshops assume no prior knowledge, but you will need a laptop (don't forget the charger) with Python 3.5 installed and a text editor (We recommend notepad++). The classes will be run on a _"Pay What You Can"_ donation basis with all proceeds going towards supporting CoderDojo helping kids learn to code.
