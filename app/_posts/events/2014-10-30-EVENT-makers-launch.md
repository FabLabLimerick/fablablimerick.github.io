Makers limerick is delighted to hold the film installation 'Starting with T'. Starting with T is a collaborative project was developed throughout 2014, which explored some ideas about women, peripheral space and community through a series of workshops: dance, movement and writing.The project was interested in getting under the skin of individual stories, to find other ways of connection. The film installation is open to multiple readings : listenings, feelings and sensings. 

Exhibition from October 30th - November 29th, Monday to Saturday 11 am to 5 pm
