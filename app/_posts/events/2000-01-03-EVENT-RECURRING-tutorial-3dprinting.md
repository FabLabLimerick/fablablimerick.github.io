Fab Lab Limerick would like to invite people from all disciplines to take part in a course on 3D printing.  It is an introductory course so no previous experienced is required.

The course will explain the concept of 3D printing and demonstrate the basics of how to use a 3D printer @ Fab Lab Limerick. 3D printing is an extremely versatile prototyping technology. A wide variety of materials can be printed on our range of open-source 3D printers. 

We encourage you to bring your own laptops on the night so that softwares can be installed and trials can be done with the printers. Our [wiki](https://github.com/FabLabLimerick/fablablimerick.github.io/wiki) has information on these softwares if you would like to get a headstart.

[You can book your place here](http://fablablimerick.ticketleap.com/introduction-to-3d-printing)
