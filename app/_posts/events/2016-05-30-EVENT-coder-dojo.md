This event is supported by Fab Foundation Ireland. This workshop is a collaboration between Coderdojo Limerick and Fab Lab Limerick. The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard usb keyboard and mouse. Don’t let their size fool you however. The Raspberry Pi is an incredibly versatile device that makers around the world have used to power some fantastic projects. Join us during European Maker Week and take your first step into the world of hardware hacking. 

During the workshop we’ll learn about the components of a computer, electrical circuits, python programming and more. Suitable for anyone aged 13+ Places are free, but [please book here](https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/raspberry-pi-python-workhop-for-beginners-tickets-25507899815#tickets)
