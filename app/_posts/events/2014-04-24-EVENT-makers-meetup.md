During our lauch event we met with lots of people who are making interesting things in Limerick. We would like to organize an evening of presentations so you can share with us all those cool projects in which you are working.

Technology, arts, design and specially all projects in which 3D printing, laser cutting and CNC Routing can be applied are welcome. 

If you want to take part send us your proposal (a photo and a short parapraph or web link is enough) for a 15 minutes presentation of the project (or projects) you want to talk about before Monday April 21st midnight. If you have any questions drop us a line or contact us via twitter [@fablablimerick](http://twitter.com/fablablimerick/)
