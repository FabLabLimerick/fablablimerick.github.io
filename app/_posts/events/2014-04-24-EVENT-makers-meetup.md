Since Fab Lab Limerick opened, we have met with lots of people who are making interesting things in Limerick. We decided to organise this evening of presentations so makers from all disciplines can share with us all those cool projects in which they are working on right now.

DAVE HUNT Dave is an embedded software engineer by day, photographer and maker by night. Most of his projects involve a Raspberry Pi or a microcontroller of some kind.

CLARE JORDAN Clare creates porcelain with passion in jewellery, table top and scultpure for personal and corporate gifting. Unique, innovative designs, beautifully handmade in Limerick.

IVOR O'SHEA Ivor is an avid 3D Printer enthusiast, blogger, follower & contributor to the RepRap community, Technology graduate, with a day-job in IT.

SML Lucia Poliakova and Mariel Mazan are LSAD visual communications graduates and they have started their own design agency this year.

*This event has free admission and no previous reservation is required.*
