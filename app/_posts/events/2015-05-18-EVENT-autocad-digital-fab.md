The  primary objective of this courseware is to teach students the basic commands necessary for 2D drawing, design, and drafting using AutoCAD . As a beginners class students will gain an understanding of the power and precision of computer-aided design and drafting. 

After completing this course, students will be able to:
* Navigate the AutoCAD user interfaces
* Use the fundamental features of AutoCAD
* Use the precision drafting tools in AutoCAD to develop accurate technical drawings
* Present drawings in a detailed and visually impressive way
* Set up a drawing for lasercutting

## WEEK ONE
There will be an introduction to digital fabrication and and what machines Autocad is compatible with. Students will be given an introduction into the AutoCad user interface and an overview of basic drawing commands, saving formats and filing conventions. Students will be asked to begin looking for a project that they can begin to start to draw up using the skills they have learned.

## WEEK TWO
We will continue to work on basic drawing commands while working on small projects. We will cover editing commands, layer management, object snaps, layout and printing.

##WEEK THREE
Students will start to draw up there projects in class and will have one on one time to deal with any issues they are struggling with. We will also cover hatching, blocks, groups, dimensioning and Text.

##WEEK FOUR
Students will finish drawing up there projects while getting one on one tutorials. Students will lasercut their designs if applicable. We will finish up with an over view of what we have covered and go through any issues that the class found difficult to grasp.
