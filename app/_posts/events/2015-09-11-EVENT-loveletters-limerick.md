In Collaboration with [Elemental Festival](http://www.elementalfestival.com/). 

Based on the craft of traditional sign writing and the art of hand-painted lettering,  'Love Letters from Limerick', will be sharing 150 years of professional sign art experience and a rare collection of Signs and Mirrors, some hundreds of years old. Sign artists Tom Collins (Limerick), Peter Mc Cullen (Drogheda) and Sean and Kayleigh Starr (Texas), will be joined by friends for this very special showcase.
 
A large scale 'Ghost Sign' project will also be created, with the involvement of local Band The Cranberries, designed and hand-painted by Sean & Kayleigh Starr and Tom Collins.
A wonderful opportunity to experience this unique art up close.
