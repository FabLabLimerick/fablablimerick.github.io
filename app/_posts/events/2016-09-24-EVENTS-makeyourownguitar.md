###Customise, modify and build an Electric Guitar 


Fab Lab Limerick would like to give everybody a chance to create a personalised electric guitar. Each participant will be given an electric guitar kit (everything necessary for a complete guitar). The course will teach how to digitally draw, how to use our laser cutter and how to use our CNC cutter. Each participant will create a custom design and execute it on the body of their guitar. 

After the bodies of the guitar have been personalised, a step by step demonstration will be done on assembling the guitar. Examples of how the guitars could be finished (painted, lacquered etc) will be shown. 

###Week 1: September 24th 14.00 to 17.00
Introduction to Guitar making and Fab Lab Limerick Space.

###Week 2: October 8th 14.00 to 18.00

###Week 3: October 22nd 11.00 to 18.00
