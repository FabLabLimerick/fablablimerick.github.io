## A New Post

In Collaboration with [Elemental Festival](http://www.elementalfestival.com/) and [Ed Devan](http://www.eddevane.com/)e (a local sound artist), Fab Lab Limerick would like to invite kids of 6 years and up to build their very own Tik-Tak-Glow instrument. 

Tik-Tak-Glow is a light and sound instrument based around the North African Tik-Tak drum. An LED (Light Emitting Diode) light circuit is incorporated into the instrument - every time the beater hits the drum heads, the light flashes. Workshop participants will learn about how a drum works, intuitively learn about electricity flow, master their sellotape skills and leave with a complete audio-visual instrument!

The workshop will last about 40 to 50 minutes. Parents or Guardians need to be present with the kids throughout the workshop.The workshop fee is â‚¬12 per kid and booking is essential.
