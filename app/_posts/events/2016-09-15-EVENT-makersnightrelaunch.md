Our Maker Night is an open night for makers, craft-ers and digital fabrication enthusiasts who meet on a weekly basis in the Fab Lab. You are welcome to join us any Thursday evening!

We will be open late each Thursday, from 7:30pm to 9:30pm. And use of all Fab Lab equipment is free in order to support your projects and to give you the chance to try out the Fab Lab for yourself. (Participants will have to have completed our introductory courses).
