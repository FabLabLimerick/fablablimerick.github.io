title: Coding Workshops with CoderDojo Limerick
---

A series of three workshops that will guide you from writing your first computer program to programming your very own text-based adventure game! CoderDojo Limerick will be running three workshops from Tuesday the 10th of November for adults interested in learning Python programming.

Workshops will run in Fab Lab Limerick from 7pm to 9pm on Tuesday 10th, 17th and 24th of November. If you would like to take part, please reserve your place [through this link](http://python1.eventbrite.ie). The classes will be run on a _"Pay What You Can"_ donation basis with all proceeds going towards supporting CoderDojo helping kids learn to code.

No prior knowledge of computer programming necessary, but you will need a laptop (don't forget the charger) with Python 3.5 installed and a text editor (We recommend notepad++).
