This course will introduce participants to the CAPD and Design for Manufacture (DFM) process. The focus will be placed on the integration of Computer Aided Design (CAD) as a key enabler to product design, development and manufacture. DFM is a methodology used to improve a product by sympathetically integrating the final manufacturing methods characteristics into the product’s design from the outset i.e. improve the product's manufacturability. In Part 1 participants will get hands on experience with Autodesk’s Fusion 360™ software (2D and 3D capability with ample functionality for even advanced users). This software is free to Start-ups, Hobbyists and Students. It is a gateway program to industry standard software such as Autodesk Inventor and AutoCAD. A structured design project is an integral part of each module, this will develop each participant's core skills with the software whilst concurrently integrating a design for manufacture methodology.
